# Anima Wishes
A very simple LIBGDX rpg game, I focused on a scalable and changeable structure but there is a lot of work to be done until this can be really a funny game. Enjoy (:

# Integrations
The project is integrated with overlap2D for interfaces and support. The game itself does not use overlap2D.

# Observations
* Using entity component system
* Screen system integrated
* Relying on tiled maps (Orthogonal ones)
* The arts are made by a friend of mine but feel free to use them (:

Recently updated to latest libGDX version... some bugs were raised but I'm out of time to track them... fell free to contribute (:
