# Anima Wishes
A very simple LIBGDX rpg game, I focused on a scalable and changeable structure but there is a lot of work to be done until this can be really a funny game. Enjoy (:

# Integrations
The project is integrated with overlap2D for interfaces and support. The game itself dont use overlap2D.

# Observations
Using entity component system
Screen system integrated
Relying on tiled maps (Orthogonal ones)
The arts are made by a friend of mine but feel free to use them (:

I hope that code and package organization are nice enough...
